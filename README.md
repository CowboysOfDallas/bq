#### Interview process<a id="interview-process"></a>
* HR screening level: Do you meet the base requirements
  * first filter by resume key words, then make sure you meet a base standard
* Junior engineer level: Could I work with you - might be direct mentor/peer
  * genuiely interested in them, could be friends after working
* Hiring manager level: management
  * will be able to hit goals without a lot of supervision, how much efforts do I need to get this person productive
* Senior manager level: culture fit and leadership potential
  * will this person stick long enough with the company and become a leader

### Pre-interview research<a id="pre-interview-research"></a>
* Company's site: culture, product set, and mission for asking specific questions
* Recent news: medium-to-large companies' strategic moves, how will my role support those goals
* Interviewer profile: interviewer's linked profile, blog, twitter

### Resume projects<a id="resume-key-projects"></a>
#### Fault tolerant distributed chat room server <a id="fault-tolerant-distributed-chat-room-server"></a>
  
### General behavior questions <a id="stories-about-general-experience"></a>
#### Principles <a id="principles"></a>
* Do not take it personal. Everything should be related to the job.
* Be specific, not arrogant: Arrogance is a red flag. To make myself sound good without be arrogant, I need to be specific by giving just the facts and letting the interviewer derive an interpretation. 
* Limit details: Stay light on details and just state the key points. When possible, try to translate it or at least explain the impact.
> By examing the most common user behavior and applying the Rabin-Karp algorithm, I designed a new algorithm to reduce search from O(n) to O(lgn) in 90% of cases. I can go into more details if you'd like. 
* Focus on yourself, not the team: Interviews are fundamentally an individual assessment. Unfortunately, when you listen to many candidates, their answers are about "we", "us" and "the team". The interviewer walks away having little idea what the candidate's actual impact was and might conclude that the candidate did little.

#### Methods: give structured answers <a id="method-give-structured-answers"></a>
* Nugget first: Starting your response with a "nugget" that succintly describes what your response will be about. This technique grabs your interviewer's attention and makes it very clear what your story will be about. It also helps you be more focused in your communication, since you've made it very clear to yourself what the gist of your response is.
> Interviewer: "Tell me about a time you had to persuade a group of people to make a big change"
> Candidate: "Sure, let me tell you about the time when I convinced my school to let undergraduates teach their own courses. Initially, my school has a rule"
* S.A.R. (Situation, Action, Result): You start off outlining the situation, then explaining the actions you took and lastly describing the result.
  * In most cases, the action is the most important part of the story. Unfortunately, far too many people talk on and on about the situation, but then just breeze through the action. Instead, dive in the action. Where possible, break down the action into multiple parts. For example, "I did three things. First, I .." This will encourage sufficient depth.

#### Know yourself <a id="know-yourself"></a>
##### Tell me about yourself<a id="tell-me-about-yourself"></a>
* **What the interviewer is really asking**: 
  * What is your career plan
  * Why are you interested in their company
* **Key points**: 
  * Step 1. What you are interested in
  * Step 2. Shape your career story into past, present & future sections
  * Step 3. (Optional) Choose whether your career story is a straight progression or if you are making a transition
  * Step 4. Why you are interested in the position/company

##### Tell me about a time you failed? How did you deal with the situation<a id="a-time-you-failed"></a>
* **What the interviewer is really asking**: 
  * Whether you could actually identify times that you could do better
  * Whether you learn from those past mistakes to become a better employee.
* **Key point**: 
  * Step 1. Pick a time that you failed in a situation where is understandable you could run into trouble.
  * Step 2. Take responsibility for any part you played in that situation.
  * Step 3. Prepare for the lesson you have learned and plan to prevent future failure. 
* **My answer**:
  * In my undergraduate study I once led a five person team and participated in a robotics competition. We decided to build something really cool - a self-balancing unicycle robot. 
  * All of us do not have prior experience in robotics. The duration of the competition was three months. We needed to build everything from scratch including hardware, electronics and software. Building a self-unicycle was far more challenging than we could ever expect. It was a too complex system for us.
  * But we learnt a great lesson from that. Never set a too fancy goal for myself, start from something simple and gradually optimize it. We should not under-estimate challenges  along the way. Instead, the right strategy is to take small steps but iterate as fast as possible. In this way, we could make sure we are continuing in the right direction and stay motivated to work because we always have achievable and challenging goals.

##### What are your strengths<a id="what-are-your-strengths"></a>
* **Key points:** How your strengths will help you be an independent worker and a team player.
* **My Answer:**
  + Eager to learn new things and share what I learn with my teammates. 
  + For example, I plan to learn XXX because XXX. 
  + I enjoy sharing what I learned with my teammates. First, teaching others help myself to udnerstand better. I need to summarize what I have learned before sharing it others. I also might have more discussions with others. I also might have new friends. Second, I could help my teammates to learn new things and help the company to build great engineering culture.

##### What is your greatest weakness<a id="what-is-your-greatest-weakness"></a>
* **key points: ( a weakness I am solving, not too critical )**
  * Not that experienced. Could solve most problems with limited guidance. 
  * Want to be perfect and finish everything. I gradually realized the importance of prioritizing my tasks and working smart. Tasks will be endless. 80% of outcome comes from 20% efforts.

##### What's your proudest professional achievement <a id="what-is-proudest-achievement"></a>
* **What the interviewer is really asking**:
  * What really motivates you
  * Whether you are a team player
  * How well can you do the job
* **Key points**:
  * Why this achievement makes you proud
  * What are the skills and qualifications that contribute to this achievement
  * Talk about any team members
* **My answer**:
  * During my internship in Finra, I built a permissions compliance system within three months. At the end of my internship, my system already run in production system. This was also beyond the expectation of my manager. 
  * I used Python Boto libraries to coordinate Splunk and many AWS services including IAM, CloudTrail and S3. I developed my program in Linux servers and it is also the first time I work with version control systems. 
  * In order to deploy the system in production environment, I needed to work closely with other department and many team members. To guarantee that I will finish building the system within three months, I have daily standup meeting with my manager to guarantee that I am always on the right track.

##### Plans for learning new programming language<a id="plans-programming-language"></a>
* I am most interested in learning Clojure, Node.js and Go.
* Reasons that I am interested (but not crazy) in Clojure. 
  * Clojure is a JVM reboot of one of the oldest languages Lisp. It also has great modern concurrency features. Clojure provides a hybrid of functional programming and mutable state, which makes it suitable for a large pool of problems. Learning Clojure is just like learning one of the oldest and newest language at the same time, ; )
  * Clojure is not a really popular language in industry. 
* Reasons that I am interested (but not crazy) in Node.js 
  * Node.js enables doing full stack development with one language. It will bring efficiency and a large pool of work forces to industry. 
  * However, I am not an advocator for programming in one paradigm. Programmers should feel free to use what fits the job most. In addition, syntactically Javascript is kind of ugly. I am not sure I want to do every web development project in Javascript.
* Reasons that I am interested (but not crazy) in Go
  * Go is invented as a C++ replacement for doing system-level programming. It has been used in more and more projects (Docker) and companies (Uber). 
  * However, Go does not have as broad applicable scenarios as Node.js. 

#### Career development <a id="career-development"></a>
##### What are the important lessons learned when you transit from a student to a professional developer < id="transition-student-developer"></a>
* Importance to improve raw productivity
* Importance to communicate well

##### Why do you want to work for us <a id="why-want-work-for-us"></a>
* **key point**: Passion about the technology. Passion about products. Great work-life balance. Great career promotion opportunities. In a word, I could learn a lot of things and make a lot of contribution here at XXX.

##### Why are you looking for a new opportunity now<a id="why-are-you-looking-for-new-opportunity"></a>
* **Key points**: No judgement ( No negative evaluation about your previous job/manager ). Try not to answer negative problems directly. Use words like: Perhaps. Say more good things about current company.
* My answer:
  * I like XXX products here and I like work-life balance here. Being part of a team to build widely known products like XXX and XXX is really rewarding and challenging for me. 

##### What is your plan in the next five years <a id="what-is-your-career-plan-in-next-five-years"></a>
* **key point**: long-term career and clear goals )
  * I am especially interested in distributed systems. I want to be a technical leader in my team. 

#### Work-life balance <a id="work-life-balance"></a>

* **What the interviewer is really asking**:
  * How do you manage multiple projects
  * How easy it would be to manage as an employee
    * How organized you are
    * Whether you can stay focus under pressure and deadlines
* **Key points**: 
  * How you specifically manage your time
  * Demonstrate that you are easy to manage
  * Work-life balance is important
* **My answer**:
  * First, I usually write down a list of things I need to do under each category of project. 
  * Then I estimate how long each of them will take. For really big tasks, I will break it into a list of small tasks.
  * Next, I will prioritize them. If there are too many deadlines, I will meet up with my manager/teammates to discuss which ones are more important.

#### Others <a id="others"></a>
##### What are your Salary requirements<a id="what-are-your-salary-requirements"></a>
* **What are your salary expectations for the job** 
 * I’m more interested in finding a position that’s a good fit for my skills and interests. I’m confident that you’re offering a salary that’s competitive in the current market.
