#### Interview process<a id="interview-process"></a>
* HR screening level: Do you meet the base requirements
  * first filter by resume key words, then make sure you meet a base standard
* Junior engineer level: Could I work with you - might be direct mentor/peer
  * genuiely interested in them, could be friends after working
* Hiring manager level: management
  * will be able to hit goals without a lot of supervision, how much efforts do I need to get this person productive
* Senior manager level: culture fit and leadership potential
  * will this person stick long enough with the company and become a leader

### Pre-interview research<a id="pre-interview-research"></a>
* Company's site: culture, product set, and mission for asking specific questions
* Recent news: medium-to-large companies' strategic moves, how will my role support those goals
* Interviewer profile: interviewer's linked profile, blog, twitter

### General behavior questions <a id="stories-about-general-experience"></a>
#### Principles <a id="principles"></a>
* Do not take it personal. Everything should be related to the job.
* Be specific, not arrogant: Arrogance is a red flag. To make myself sound good without be arrogant, I need to be specific by giving just the facts and letting the interviewer derive an interpretation. 
* Limit details: Stay light on details and just state the key points. When possible, try to translate it or at least explain the impact.
> By examing the most common user behavior and applying the Rabin-Karp algorithm, I designed a new algorithm to reduce search from O(n) to O(lgn) in 90% of cases. I can go into more details if you'd like. 
* Focus on yourself, not the team: Interviews are fundamentally an individual assessment. Unfortunately, when you listen to many candidates, their answers are about "we", "us" and "the team". The interviewer walks away having little idea what the candidate's actual impact was and might conclude that the candidate did little.

#### Methods: give structured answers <a id="method-give-structured-answers"></a>
* Nugget first: Starting your response with a "nugget" that succintly describes what your response will be about. This technique grabs your interviewer's attention and makes it very clear what your story will be about. It also helps you be more focused in your communication, since you've made it very clear to yourself what the gist of your response is.
> Interviewer: "Tell me about a time you had to persuade a group of people to make a big change"
> Candidate: "Sure, let me tell you about the time when I convinced my school to let undergraduates teach their own courses. Initially, my school has a rule"
* S.A.R. (Situation, Action, Result): You start off outlining the situation, then explaining the actions you took and lastly describing the result.
  * In most cases, the action is the most important part of the story. Unfortunately, far too many people talk on and on about the situation, but then just breeze through the action. Instead, dive in the action. Where possible, break down the action into multiple parts. For example, "I did three things. First, I .." This will encourage sufficient depth.

#### Know yourself <a id="know-yourself"></a>
##### Tell me about yourself<a id="tell-me-about-yourself"></a>
* **What the interviewer is really asking**: 
  * What is your career plan
  * Why are you interested in their company
* **Key points**: 
  * Step 1. What you are interested in
  * Step 2. Your current role
  * Step 3. Past and onwards
  * Step 5. Future. Why you are interested in role, position, company

##### What are your strengths<a id="what-are-your-strengths"></a>
* **Key points:** How your strengths will help you be an independent worker and a team player.
* **My Answer:**
  + There is a book called "Strengths Finder 2.0" and it offers a set of online assessment. 
  + One of my dominant strengths is focus.  
    - First, I thrive in environments where goal-setting discussions are commonplace and clearly defined objectives are agreed upon. By nature I am industrious and persistent and I am always able to stay on track with little supervision. Second, as a team member, this talents might be used helping others set goals. For example, at the end of meetings, I am happy to take the responsibility for summarizing what was decided, for defining when these decisions will be acted on, and for setting a date when the group will reconvene. 
    - Everything is two-sided. My focus talents also means that others will think, act and talk less efficiently than I do. But I should pay attention because sometimes their detours will lead to discoveries and delights. The second is that hours can disappear when I am intent on a task and I lose track of time. I need to make sure that all of my objects are met and all of my priorities are followed by scheduling my efforts and sticking to the schedule. 

##### What is your greatest weakness<a id="what-is-your-greatest-weakness"></a>
* **key points: ( a weakness I am solving, not too critical )**
  + I do not derive a lot of satisfaction from meeting new people, breaking the ice and making connection with another person because I feel that is superficial. But I do understand that networking is an essential part of professional career. So usually before I meet a new person, I will do intensive research on that person to guarantee that our conversations can go really deep and I can learn something from the process. 

##### What's your proudest professional achievement <a id="what-is-proudest-achievement"></a>
* **What the interviewer is really asking**:
  * What really motivates you
  * Whether you are a team player
  * How well can you do the job
* **Key points**:
  * Why this achievement makes you proud
  * What are the skills and qualifications that contribute to this achievement
  * Talk about any team members
* **My answer**:
  * During my internship in Finra, I built a permissions compliance system within three months. At the end of my internship, my system already run in production system. This was also beyond the expectation of my manager. 
  * I used Python Boto libraries to coordinate Splunk and many AWS services including IAM, CloudTrail and S3. I developed my program in Linux servers and it is also the first time I work with version control systems. 
  * In order to deploy the system in production environment, I needed to work closely with other department and many team members. To guarantee that I will finish building the system within three months, I have daily standup meeting with my manager to guarantee that I am always on the right track.

##### Plans for learning new programming language<a id="plans-programming-language"></a>
* I am most interested in learning Clojure, Node.js and Go.
* Reasons that I am interested (but not crazy) in Clojure. 
  * Clojure is a JVM reboot of one of the oldest languages Lisp. It also has great modern concurrency features. Clojure provides a hybrid of functional programming and mutable state, which makes it suitable for a large pool of problems. Learning Clojure is just like learning one of the oldest and newest language at the same time, ; )
  * Clojure is not a really popular language in industry. 
* Reasons that I am interested (but not crazy) in Node.js 
  * Node.js enables doing full stack development with one language. It will bring efficiency and a large pool of work forces to industry. 
  * However, I am not an advocator for programming in one paradigm. Programmers should feel free to use what fits the job most. In addition, syntactically Javascript is kind of ugly. I am not sure I want to do every web development project in Javascript.
* Reasons that I am interested (but not crazy) in Go
  * Go is invented as a C++ replacement for doing system-level programming. It has been used in more and more projects (Docker) and companies (Uber). 
  * However, Go does not have as broad applicable scenarios as Node.js. 

#### Career development <a id="career-development"></a>
##### What are the important lessons learned when you transit from a student to a professional developer < id="transition-student-developer"></a>
* Importance to improve raw productivity
* Importance to communicate well

##### Why do you want to work for us <a id="why-want-work-for-us"></a>
* **key point**: 1. Passion about the technology. Passion about products. Great work-life balance. Great career promotion opportunities. 2. Technical competency. In a word, I could learn a lot of things and make a lot of contribution here at XXX. 
* Why you believe that you will bring more values to the job and company than it will cost the company to hire you, and give examples. If the company has discussed four critical tasks that need to be tackled, and you have the experience and talent to do them, confidently review the skills you are bring with you which will successfully accomplish your goals. 

##### What did you dislike about your last/present job <a id="what-did-you-dislike-about-your-last-job"></a>
* **key point**: 
  - Limit on negatives: The top management has changed, and their philosophy is not one I agree with. The company is downsizing and future growth no longer looks positive. 
  - Focus more on positives that motivates you: What I enjoyed most about my present situation is working directly with ....That part of my job provides me with a lot of challenge and gives me the personal satisfaction of knowing my talent is being used to the company's advantage. 

##### What have you accomplished in the past year, past 2 years, etc <a id="what-have-you-accomplished-in-the-past-year"></a>

##### Why are you looking for a new opportunity now<a id="why-are-you-looking-for-new-opportunity"></a>
* **Key points**: No judgement ( No negative evaluation about your previous job/manager ). Try not to answer negative problems directly. Use words like: Perhaps. Say more good things about current company.
* My answer:
  * I like XXX products here and I like work-life balance here. Being part of a team to build widely known products like XXX and XXX is really rewarding and challenging for me. 

##### What is your plan in the next five years <a id="what-is-your-career-plan-in-next-five-years"></a>
* **key point**: clear goals, self-improvement, Combine your development with company's development.
  * Team perspective: Currently within my team I am the implementor, basically carrying out the directives of someone else. In five years, I hope I could be the major contributor and initiator of the team who comes up with ideas and take most responsibilities.
  * Personal perspective: Learn more about XXX technology.

* **What the interviewer is really asking**:
  * How do you manage multiple projects
  * How easy it would be to manage as an employee
    * How organized you are
    * Whether you can stay focus under pressure and deadlines
* **Key points**: 
  * How you specifically manage your time
  * Demonstrate that you are easy to manage
  * Work-life balance is important
* **My answer**:
  * First, I usually write down a list of things I need to do under each category of project. 
  * Then I estimate how long each of them will take. For really big tasks, I will break it into a list of small tasks.
  * Next, I will prioritize them. If there are too many deadlines, I will meet up with my manager/teammates to discuss which ones are more important.

#### Teamwork <a id="teamwork"></a>
##### How do you deal with conflicts <a id="deal-with-conflicts-with-colleague"></a>

  * Tell me about a time you had a conflict at work.
  * Give an example of a time you had to respond to an unhappy manager/customer/colleague.
  * Tell me about a time that you disagreed with a rule or approach.
* **Key points**: Do not take it personal. Discuss the difference. Figure the best solutions for team/company. 
* Steps
  * Talk with the other person
    * Ask the other person to name a time when it would be convenient to meet.
    * Arrange to meet in a place where you won't be interrupted.
  * Focus on behavior and events, not on personalities.
    * Say “When this happens …” instead of “When you do …”
    * Describe a specific instance or event instead of generalizing.
  * Listen carefully
    * Listen to what the other person is saying instead of getting ready to react.
    * Avoid interrupting the other person.
    * After the other person finishes speaking, rephrase what was said to make sure you understand it.
    * Ask questions to clarify your understanding.
  * Identify points of agreement and disagreement.
    * Summarize the areas of agreement and disagreement.
    * Ask the other person if he or she agrees with your assessment.
    * Modify your assessment until both of you agree on the areas of conflict.
  * Prioritize the areas of conflict.
    * Discuss which areas of conflict are most important to each of you to resolve.

    * Compliment the other person’s insights and achievements.
    * Congratulate each other when you make progress, even if it’s just a small step. Your hard work will pay off when scheduled discussions eventually give way to ongoing, friendly communication.
* Follow-up: What if you cannot persuade your colleagues although you try a lot?
  * If this thing is on my priority list, I will insist on my idea. Put my idea into practice quickly and verify it is right or not. If after fast prototyping and I found my idea is proved to be wrong, I will correct my errors. 

##### Tell me about a time you failed? How did you deal with the situation<a id="a-time-you-failed"></a>
* **What the interviewer is really asking**: 
  * Whether you could actually identify times that you could do better
  * Whether you learn from those past mistakes to become a better employee.
* **Key point**: 
  * Step 1. Pick a time that you failed in a situation where is understandable you could run into trouble.
  * Step 2. Take responsibility for any part you played in that situation.
  * Step 3. Elaborate on all efforts you spend to overcome the problem. 
  * Step 4. Prepare for the lesson you have learned and plan to prevent future failure. 
* **My answer**:
  * In my undergraduate study I once led a five person team and participated in a robotics competition. We decided to build something really cool - a self-balancing unicycle robot. 
  * All of us do not have prior experience in robotics. The duration of the competition was three months. We needed to build everything from scratch including hardware, electronics and software. Building a self-unicycle was far more challenging than we could ever expect. It was a too complex system for us.
  * But we learnt a great lesson from that. Never set a too fancy goal for myself, start from something simple and gradually optimize it. We should not under-estimate challenges  along the way. Instead, the right strategy is to take small steps but iterate as fast as possible. In this way, we could make sure we are continuing in the right direction and stay motivated to work because we always have achievable and challenging goals.

##### Have your suggestion being adopted <a id="have-your-suggestion-being-adopted"></a>

##### What will you do if you are 100% that your boss is wrong <a id="what-will-you-do-if-your-boss-is-wrong"></a>
* **Key point: 1. Depends on the scenario. In a casual chatting, informal meeting 2. If my boss does not like other people challenging him, then I will go with his ideas. For the specific part I feel he is wrong, I will let the fact speak for me and before implementation, ask if I made some changes, will it be fine? In this way, I will avoid conflicts and simultaneously get the job done.** 

##### How do you finish an impossible task <a id="how-do-you-finish-an-impossible-task"></a>
* **Key point: pressure handling. Prioritize**

##### Have you ever did more than required <a id="have-you-ever-did-more-than-required"></a>
* **Key point: Self-motivated. Independent problem solver. Initiate**

##### How do you compare yourself to your peers <a id="how-do-you-compare-yourself-to-peers"></a>

##### Belbin's team roles <a id="belbin-team-roles"></a>
* Action oriented roles
  - Shaper
    + Shapers are people who challenge the team to improve. They are dynamic and usually extroverted people who enjoy stimulating others, questioning norms, and finding the best approaches for solving problems. The Shaper is the one who shakes things up to make sure that all possibilities are considered and that the team does not become complacent.
    + Shapers often see obstacles as exciting challenges and they tend to have the courage to push on when others feel like quitting.
    + Their potential weaknesses may be that they're argumentative, and that they may offend people's feelings.
  - Implementer
    + Implementers are the people who get things done. They turn the team's ideas and concepts into practical actions and plans. They are typically conservative, disciplined people who work systematically and efficiently and are very well organized. These are the people who you can count on to get the job done.
    + On the downside, Implementers may be inflexible and can be somewhat resistant to change.
  - Completer-Finisher (CF)
    + Completer-Finishers are the people who see that projects are completed thoroughly. They ensure there have been no errors or omissions and they pay attention to the smallest of details. They are very concerned with deadlines and will push the team to make sure the job is completed on time. They are described as perfectionists who are orderly, conscientious and anxious.
    + However, a Completer-Finisher may worry unnecessarily, and may find it hard to delegate.
* People oriented roles
  - Coordinator
    + Coordinators are the ones who take on the traditional team-leader role and have also been referred to as the chairmen. They guide the team to what they perceive are the objectives. They are often excellent listeners and they are naturally able to recognize the value that each team member brings to the table. They are calm and good-natured, and delegate tasks very effectively.
    + Their potential weaknesses are that they may delegate away too much personal responsibility, and may tend to be manipulative.
  - Team Worker (TW)
    + Team Workers are the people who provide support and make sure that people within the team are working together effectively. These people fill the role of negotiators within the team and they are flexible, diplomatic and perceptive. These tend to be popular people who are very capable in their own right, but who prioritize team cohesion and helping people get along.
    + Their weaknesses may be a tendency to be indecisive, and to maintain uncommitted positions during discussions and decision-making.
  - Resource Investigator (RI)
    + Resource Investigators are innovative and curious. They explore available options, develop contacts, and negotiate for resources on behalf of the team. They are enthusiastic team members, who identify and work with external stakeholders to help the team accomplish its objective. They are outgoing and are often extroverted, meaning that others are often receptive to them and their ideas.
    + On the downside, they may lose enthusiasm quickly, and are often overly optimistic.
* Thought oriented roles
  - Plant
    + The Plant is the creative innovator who comes up with new ideas and approaches. They thrive on praise but criticism is especially hard for them to deal with. Plants are often introverted and prefer to work apart from the team. Because their ideas are so novel, they can be impractical at times. They may also be poor communicators and can tend to ignore given parameters and constraints.
  - Monitor-Evaluator
    + Monitor-Evaluators are best at analyzing and evaluating ideas that other people (often Plants) come up with. These people are shrewd and objective, and they carefully weigh the pros and cons of all the options before coming to a decision.
    + Monitor-Evaluators are critical thinkers and very strategic in their approach. They are often perceived as detached or unemotional. Sometimes they are poor motivators who react to events rather than instigating them
  - Specialist
    + Specialists are people who have specialized knowledge that is needed to get the job done. They pride themselves on their skills and abilities, and they work to maintain their professional status. Their job within the team is to be an expert in the area, and they commit themselves fully to their field of expertise.
    + This may limit their contribution, and lead to a preoccupation with technicalities at the expense of the bigger picture.
