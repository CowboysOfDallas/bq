### Stories about general experience<a id="stories-about-general-experience"></a>
#### Know yourself <a id="know-yourself"></a>
##### Tell me about yourself<a id="tell-me-about-yourself"></a>
* **What the interviewer is really asking**: 
  * What is your career plan
  * Why are you interested in their company
* **Key points**: 
  * Step 1. Shape your career story into past, present & future sections
  * Step 2. Choose whether your career story is a straight progression or if you are making a transition
* **My answer**:
  * I tried on a lot of different areas including robotics, computer vision and information security, distributed system during my school years. I found myself really like building things, especially things related with distributed systems. There are so many things which could go wrong and there are so many trade offs and decisions to make.
  * During my internship and work, I learned many popular big data and distributed technologies and industrial development processes. I am ready to move my career to next stage and continue my journey in distributed systems.

##### Tell me about a time you failed? How did you deal with the situation<a id="a-time-you-failed"></a>
* **What the interviewer is really asking**: 
  * Whether you could actually identify times that you could do better
  * Whether you learn from those past mistakes to become a better employee.
* **Key point**: 
  * Step 1. Pick a time that you failed in a situation where is understandable you could run into trouble.
  * Step 2. Take responsibility for any part you played in that situation.
  * Step 3. Prepare for the lesson you have learned and plan to prevent future failure. 
* **My answer**:
  * In my undergraduate study I once led a five person team and participated in a robotics competition. We decided to build something really cool - a self-balancing unicycle robot. 
  * All of us do not have prior experience in robotics. The duration of the competition was three months. We needed to build everything from scratch including hardware, electronics and software. Building a self-unicycle was far more challenging than we could ever expect. It was a too complex system for us.
  * But we learnt a great lesson from that. Never set a too fancy goal for myself, start from something simple and gradually optimize it. We should not under-estimate challenges  along the way. Instead, the right strategy is to take small steps but iterate as fast as possible. In this way, we could make sure we are continuing in the right direction and stay motivated to work because we always have achievable and challenging goals.

##### What are your strengths<a id="what-are-your-strengths"></a>

##### What is your greatest weakness<a id="what-is-your-greatest-weakness"></a>
* **key points: ( a weakness I am solving )**
 * I used to spend too much time on perfecting details and kind of forget the big picture. Recently I was learning tools such as MindMap/GTD/Omnifocus to help me manage goals and keep a good pace. 

##### What's your proudest professional achievement <a id="what-is-proudest-achievement"></a>
* **What the interviewer is really asking**:
  * What really motivates you
  * Whether you are a team player
  * How well can you do the job
* **Key points**:
  * Why this achievement makes you proud
  * What are the skills and qualifications that contribute to this achievement
  * Talk about any team members
* **My answer**:
  * During my internship in Finra, I built a permissions compliance system within three months. At the end of my internship, my system already run in production system. This was also beyond the expectation of my manager. 
  * I used Python Boto libraries to coordinate Splunk and many AWS services including IAM, CloudTrail and S3. I developed my program in Linux servers and it is also the first time I work with version control systems. 
  * In order to deploy the system in production environment, I needed to work closely with other department and many team members. To guarantee that I will finish building the system within three months, I have daily standup meeting with my manager to guarantee that I am always on the right track.

##### Plans for learning new programming language<a id="plans-programming-language"></a>
* I am most interested in learning Clojure, Node.js and Go.
* Reasons that I am interested (but not crazy) in Clojure. 
  * Clojure is a JVM reboot of one of the oldest languages Lisp. It also has great modern concurrency features. Clojure provides a hybrid of functional programming and mutable state, which makes it suitable for a large pool of problems. Learning Clojure is just like learning one of the oldest and newest language at the same time, ; )
  * Clojure is not a really popular language in industry. 
* Reasons that I am interested (but not crazy) in Node.js 
  * Node.js enables doing full stack development with one language. It will bring efficiency and a large pool of work forces to industry. 
  * However, I am not an advocator for programming in one paradigm. Programmers should feel free to use what fits the job most. In addition, syntactically Javascript is kind of ugly. I am not sure I want to do every web development project in Javascript.
* Reasons that I am interested (but not crazy) in Go
  * Go is invented as a C++ replacement for doing system-level programming. It has been used in more and more projects (Docker) and companies (Uber). 
  * However, Go does not have as broad applicable scenarios as Node.js. 

##### What achievement are you most proud of<a id="achievement-most-proud-of"></a>
* **key point**: two or three achievements most proud of and how does the achievement fits with the company

#### Career development <a id="career-development"></a>
#### Why do you want to work for us<a id="why-want-work-for-us"></a>

##### Why are you looking for a new opportunity now<a id="why-are-you-looking-for-new-opportunity"></a>
* **key point: opportunity to learn**
 * I am interested in large-scale distributed systems. 
 * I have learned a lot about distributed web apps/big data by myself and is gradually accumulating a long list of personal projects, as you could see on my resume. 
 * I really value the opportunity here at XXX to learn more about XXX.

##### What is your plan in the next five years<a id="what-is-your-career-plan-in-next-five-years"></a>
* **Short-term goals** ( key point: be general )
 * As a junior software engineer, I will try my best to get myself into a good shape as soon as possible.
 * I am willing to do whatever I could do to help team to move forward.
* **Long-term goals** ( key point: stress interest in long-term career )
 * My goal right now is to find a position at a company where I can grow and take on new challenges over time.
 * Some of the most innovative thinkers in the industry work here and that’s a big reason why I would love to build a career here.
* **In a word** my goal is always to reach beyond the company's expectations on me. I will try my best to create more value for the company.

#### Work-life balance <a id="work-life-balance"></a>
##### How did you manage your time and prioritize your tasks?<a id="prioritize-task"></a>
* **What the interviewer is really asking**:
  * How do you manage multiple projects
  * How easy it would be to manage as an employee
    * How organized you are
    * Whether you can stay focus under pressure and deadlines
* **Key points**: 
  * How you specifically manage your time
  * Demonstrate that you are easy to manage
  * Work-life balance is important
* **My answer**:
  * First, I usually write down a list of things I need to do under each category of project. 
  * Then I estimate how long each of them will take. For really big tasks, I will break it into a list of small tasks.
  * Next, I will prioritize them. If there are too many deadlines, I will meet up with my manager/teammates to discuss which ones are more important.

* **What are your salary expectations for the job** 
 * I’m more interested in finding a position that’s a good fit for my skills and interests. I’m confident that you’re offering a salary that’s competitive in the current market.
* **When interviewers press further for a specific number**
